A clientside webbrowser application

# Want to run it locally?
Just opening index.html sadly won't do the trick. Because of CORS, your initial request has to be http. Put it on a local webserver and it should work


# Changelog
<ul>
<li>Fixed CORS Problem where website would freeze on some browsers (changed absolute to relative reference; XMLHttpRequest)</li>
<li>Changed href from source-buttons from sourceCode.html to this Github page</li>
</ul>
